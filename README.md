Hello, I developed a taboo game with Swift.
Red and Blue are played as a team. During the game, you try to tell your friend the relevant word without saying the forbidden words.

You get +1 for every word that is known correctly and -1 for every word that is taboo.

This game develops your quick thinking and expression skills while expanding your vocabulary.

You can customize the lap time, number of laps and pass.
